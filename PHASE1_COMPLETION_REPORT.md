## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Option A: Continue Full Implementation (Recommended)
**Timeline:** 7 weeks  
**Effort:** High  
**Outcome:** Production-ready v2.1.0

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor CI/CD for failures and fix immediately
2. Replace remaining 77 `.unwrap()` calls using SafeLock
3. Integrate validation into all API entry points
4. Begin Phase 2: Refactor main.js

### Option B: Focus on Critical Only
**Timeline:** 2 weeks  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Outcome:** Stable security fixes only

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix only the most critical unwrap() calls (audio.rs)
2. Add validation to LLM client only
3. Remove CI/CD masking
4. Merge to main

### Option C: Deploy Current State
**Timeline:** Today  
**Effort:** Low  
**Outcome:** Phase 1 security foundation deployed

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for CI/CD to complete
2. If builds pass, merge to main
3. Deploy as hotfix release
4. Plan Phase 2 for next sprint
