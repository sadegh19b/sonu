# Contributing to SONU

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SONU! This project was built by a solo developer using TraeAI IDE and AI assistance, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help maintain a positive environment

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/ai-dev-2024/sonu.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Install Python dependencies: `pip install faster-whisper pyaudio keyboard`
5. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

### Testing Workflow

- Run tests from the `tests` workspace:
  ```bash
  cd tests
  npm install
  npm run test:unit
  npm run test:integration
  npm run test:e2e
  ```
- From project root, you can also invoke Jest directly:
  ```bash
  npx jest tests/unit --runInBand
  npx jest tests/integration --runInBand
  npx jest tests/e2e --runInBand
  ```
- Renderer unit tests expose `window.__rendererTestHooks` to make UI assertions deterministic.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow existing code patterns
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Format: `type: description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Testing

- Test all new features thoroughly
- Test on Windows 10 and 11
- Verify hotkey functionality
- Test theme switching
- Check system-wide typing
- Ensure unit, integration, and E2E tests pass locally (see the commands above)

### Documentation Updates

- Update `README.md` when adding commands or changing setup.
- Keep `AUTOMATION_README.md` / `AUTOMATION_SETUP.md` aligned with automation outputs.
- Document known test issues or environment requirements in `tests/README.md`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Submit PR with clear description
5. Wait for review and feedback
