## 📝 Notes for Future Development

### Code Standards (Enforced)
1. **All inputs must be validated** using `validation.js`
2. **All spawns must use** `errorHandler.safeSpawn()`
3. **All errors must be handled** with proper user feedback
4. **All code must pass** ESLint before commit
5. **All changes must have** corresponding tests

### Testing Requirements
1. **No local testing** - use GitHub Actions
2. **All PRs must pass** CI before merge
3. **Coverage must not decrease** below 40%
4. **Security scans** run automatically

### Release Process
1. Update version numbers
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create git tag
4. Push to trigger Actions
5. Monitor release pipeline
6. Verify artifacts created
